# Heart-Data-Analysis

### Project Overview
The Heart Disease Data Analysis project utilizes data sourced from Kaggle to investigate the factors contributing to heart disease among individuals. We aim to explore various parameters such as BMI, smoking and drinking habits, physical and mental health conditions, gender, age categories, diabetic status, physical activity levels, and kidney disease, among others, to discern their potential influence on heart disease occurrence.

### Data Sources
We have taken the data from the below file for data analysis purpose.

### Tools
- Jupyter Notebook

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed using Python, involving the elimination of duplicate entries within columns, trimming extra spaces from column names, and checking for null values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Analysis of the prevalence of heart disease compared to other categories within the extracted data file.
2. Which gender exhibits a higher propensity for experiencing a heart attack?
3. Which age categories show a higher susceptibility to heart attacks?
4. Does BMI play a role in the development of heart disease?
5. Is smoking considered a contributing factor to heart disease?
6. Does alcohol consumption contribute to heart disease?
7. What is the overall health status of individuals with heart disease?
8. Is there a correlation between asthma, kidney diseases, and heart disease?
9. Is there a link between diabetes and heart disease?
